This repository will be used to save time and repetition in identifying a query of information from Spatial Analysis Final Project

My project challenge is to query information from a .dat file, which gives location information for Cell Towers across the United States. I only want to work with the GA files. I estimate there will be around 2000-3000 tower locations in the state of Georgia queried from about 15,000 towers across the country. The method I started to use: opens a .dat file, imports it into WordPad, and then I go through and change the font color between LO and ||||| where GA is between those characters. After which, I would save the font changed file as GA towers. I will then need to bring that file into ArcMap to show the Geospatial Locations.
